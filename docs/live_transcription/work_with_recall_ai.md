# Getting Started with the Recall API

## Overview of the Recall API
The Recall API is designed to facilitate the recording, transcribing, and management of bot recordings for real-time conversations. This API is particularly useful for experimentation and testing, enabling users to record conversations in a scalable, efficient way.

## 1. Documentation & Resources
* **API Documentation**: Start by reviewing the Recall API Documentation to understand endpoint options, required parameters, authentication methods, and response structures.

## 2. Your Account
To use the Recall API, follow these steps:
* **Sign Up for Pay-As-You-Go**: Designed for testing and experimentation, Recall's Pay-As-You-Go model enables usage without a formal contract.
* **Pricing**: The rate is **$1/hr per bot recording** and is billed via Stripe.
* **Concurrency Limits**: Users can run up to **20 bots concurrently** with a maximum duration of **2 hours per bot session**.

## 3. Working with the API
* **Bot Recording & Transcription**: Configure bots to join, record, and transcribe calls based on your application needs. Use parameters within the API to manage recordings, set time limits, and control bot behavior.
* **Testing and Experimentation**: The Pay-As-You-Go model supports early-stage experimentation, ideal for trial setups with **early adopters and design partners**.
