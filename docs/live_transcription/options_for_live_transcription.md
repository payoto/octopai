# Decision Options for Live Transcription SDK Integration

## Purpose
This document outlines options for implementing live transcription capabilities, comparing SDK-based integrations (Recall.ai) with alternative methods.

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Recall.ai
**Description**: API integrating with Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet for real-time meeting data access.

**Pros**:
- Unified integration across platforms
- Consistent API reducing complexity
- Reliable real-time transcription with metadata
- Perfect diarization

**Cons**:
- API dependency (€1/hour)
- Limited customization

**Suggestion**: Start with Google Meet for easier implementation and no review process. Add other services later if successful.

### Option 2: Direct Microphone Audio Capture
**Description**: Captures audio directly without joining meetings as participant.

**Pros**:
- Platform-independent audio capture
- Simplified setup

**Cons**:
- Real-time transcription distortion
- Limited services with live speaker diarization (€1/hour)
- Hosting requirements for whisperX

### Option 3: SDK + Transcription Model

#### Zoom SDK
**Pros**:
- Direct access to Zoom features
- Comprehensive documentation
- Built-in transcription support

**Cons**:
- Zoom-specific
- Complex development
- 6-month review process

#### Microsoft Teams SDK
**Pros**:
- Native Teams integration

**Cons**:
- Teams-specific
- Complex cross-platform implementation
- No built-in live transcription

#### Google Meet API
**Pros**:
- Seamless Google Workspace integration

**Cons**:
- Google Meet-specific
- Limited documentation
- No built-in live transcription
