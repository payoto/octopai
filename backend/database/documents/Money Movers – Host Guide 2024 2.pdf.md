# Heard about Money Movers and want to get involved?

This guide covers how to become a Money Movers host, step by step. Taking on a new project can be daunting, so we'll make sure you have all the support and guidance to make hosting easy and fun!

By becoming a Money Movers host, you'll be creating a relaxed space for friends, family, neighbours or colleagues to come together and learn. You'll explore your personal finances, the relationship between finances and the climate crisis, and some actions you can take to make your money go further for both you and the planet.

This isn't an education programme where the host has all the answers. Instead, it's about peer-to-peer learning - everyone pooling together to learn as a group. Money Movers provides a structure to help you explore topics and take action, but your group leads the way. We believe this approach is more empowering for everyone involved.

> "[Money Movers is] an incredible programme. Of all the attempts at behavioural change initiatives I have seen, this model wins. An innovative, thoughtful approach to an 'age-old' problem."
> 
> Kate Ford, Money Movers participant and peer group host

Each Money Movers programme will look a little different, because every host is different and everyone in the group will have their own schedules and needs. We hope you'll feel able to tailor the process to your group.

Broadly speaking, a Money Movers programme will look something like this...

# Principles and top tips

## Principles

- This is informal. That's super important. Hosting a meeting can feel like work, but it doesn't have to. Whether you're meeting virtually or in-person, we hope you and the people you bring together feel like you're round a kitchen table.

- This is your process to own. We've provided session plans and resources to support you to host an effective and enjoyable series of sessions. But we don't want you to feel like you're doing it "wrong" if sessions deviate from that structure, if the participants want to bring their own ideas, or if you don't manage to get through everything in the time.

- Money Movers is about more than just empowerment around financial choices. It's about the environmental impact of those choices. It's part of your role as host to keep bringing this into the conversation.

- Having said that, as a Money Movers host, you should never give advice. Make it clear to your group that you're a volunteer and not sharing professional expertise on climate-positive finance (even if this is your day job). This is about exploring together with curiosity, encouragement and support.

- Similarly, don't feel you have to have all the answers. If a question arises that you can't answer, it's totally fine to suggest that participant does some research and comes to the next session with an answer for the group.
---
# Principles and top tips

## Top tips

- Take time to make a group agreement. Though it may sound a bit formal, these are a helpful way to agree how you'll make the space feel as safe as possible. Your group will all likely have different needs, preferences and experiences, so having a discussion at the start helps create a supportive space throughout the 3 sessions. If you'd like to find out more about hosting safer spaces, there are more resources in the FAQs.

- We strongly encourage you to start each session with a check-in. A check-in is a simple process which encourages connection and empathy and helps break the ice. We've suggested some check-ins in the session plans.

- Make space for each person to speak and be listened to respectfully. Talking about topics like money, which are usually off-limits, can make people feel vulnerable. People will have different levels of comfort with this. Women and non-binary people, as well as people with other minority identities, often aren't well served by the financial sector, so may feel less confident than others in your group. As host, you can remind the group of your group agreement if the conversation veers off track.

# Recruiting your group

MONEY MOVERS

# Recruitment tips

Your goal is to find 3-8 people to participate in your sessions (although if you only find 1-2 that's fine too).

Think about who you want to invite to your group. Would you prefer if your group was just for women and non-binary people, for instance? Money Movers is for people who'd like to grow their financial confidence, so those who are generally marginalised by and under-represented in the financial sector may find it particularly helpful.

Putting yourself out there and inviting others to join can be a little daunting. So here are some tips to help you reach out to friends, family, colleagues and community members.

| Tip | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Decide if you'll host in-person or online. | This will help you to decide who to reach out to. Is this group for your neighbours or your LinkedIn network? |
| Start with friends, family and professional contacts. | The best place to start is with those you already know. Don't second-guess who might like to get involved, as there's no harm in asking. |
| Think about which groups, networks or hubs you can tap into. | Are you a member of online communities (eg Facebook or Slack groups) where people would be interested? Go to where the people are! |
| Don't worry if not everyone you speak to is interested. | It won't be for everyone, and that's ok. Or you might speak to people who like the idea but it's not the right time. |
| Lean on the resources, templates and text we've provided below – but make them your own! | Think of these as a crib sheet to riff off. They should help keep things simple and easy to share. |
| Share your personal motivation for hosting. | Why did you want to host? Why do you want to be part of this project? People are more likely to connect to a heartfelt, authentic message. |
| Think about how to approach dates and scheduling. | You can either set the dates upfront or decide together. It's good to set a specific day of the week, otherwise you can get caught in endless diary-wrangling. |

# How to get people involved

## Direct messaging
Use email, WhatsApp or your preferred social media platform to contact people and see if they're interested.

## Posting online
Find groups of people online who you think would be interested. Think about communities of interest, organisations, networks and hubs:

- Slack channels
- Facebook groups
- LinkedIn groups
- Employee intranets
- WhatsApp groups.

Note: it's always important to think about whether the group organiser encourages or discourages sharing of such opportunities. If in doubt, drop them a line to ask them what they think first.

## Face-to-face
Don't forget the power of simply talking to your friends and colleagues about what you're up to. They might be interested themselves or know someone who would be.

## Template post for Facebook, LinkedIn or Instagram

Hi [XXXX]. Anyone out there curious to know how their financial choices can fight climate change?

I'm volunteering as a host with Money Movers, a movement of people supporting each other to take climate action with their personal finances – however much they have.

I'm recruiting a peer group of around 5 people to join me for a mini programme of 3 sessions. In these sessions we'll explore the issues, learn together and support one another to take action.

If you think you might be interested or know someone else who would be, you can throw your hat into the ring by commenting below or getting in touch with me for a quick chat. [consider including email address]

Hi [insert name],

[Insert personal message.]

I'm writing to tell you about a new project I'm embarking on called Money Movers...

Money Movers is a movement of people supporting each other to take climate action with their personal finances – however much they have.

When personal finance comes second only to our mental health and sex lives as the most awkward discussion topic, we know we need to break some taboos. Whether it's pensions, purchases or investments, people want to put their money to work for a fair and healthy planet, but often don't feel served by a jargon-filled financial system that can feel alienating, patronising and out of touch.

Empowering friends, family, neighbours and colleagues to make climate-positive financial decisions is a huge opportunity in tackling our generation's most urgent challenge.

So far, participants in Money Movers pilots have moved over £3.3 million for the planet. Taking part in a Money Movers programme leads participants to actions such as switching their bank accounts, pensions, savings and investments to greener options.

I'm volunteering to host a mini programme of 3 sessions for a small group of people to explore these issues, learn together and support one another to take action.

I'm looking for 2 things:
1. People who'd like to be part of the peer group
2. Support to spread the word and reach people who'd like to participate.

I'm writing to you because [delete as appropriate: I thought this might be right up your street/ I wondered if you might help me spread the word] [add more detail, personal comments, asks].

Let me know what you think!

# Setting up your sessions

You've successfully recruited a Money Movers group – well done! Now it's time to get ready for your Money Movers journey...

## Where you'll host

If you haven't already, think about where you'll host your sessions. In your house? Online? A mix of both, with some online sessions and some in person? Could you use a local community space for free? Perhaps a café or pub, but consider if meeting in a public space could make people feel less able to share their experiences and questions openly.

## Accommodating needs

Chat to your participants and check if they have any needs you're able to accommodate (eg these could be access needs or preferred communication methods) as well as questions before the first session. There'll be more space to talk about the group's needs when you make your group agreement together in the first session.

## Survey

Share the pre-programme survey with participants and encourage them to fill it in before the first session.

## Sessions

We suggest hosting 3 x 90-minute sessions, once a fortnight over 6 weeks. You can always make the sessions shorter or adapt the timings to work for your group. We've found that 2 weeks between sessions gives enough time for research while keeping the momentum going. But it's up to you to decide what will work best for the needs and schedules of your group. The main thing is to get the dates booked in to keep the momentum up.

## Communication

We recommend you set up a WhatsApp chat (or equivalent) for your Money Movers group. This helps build connection and can be used to share resources and practical information about the sessions.

# Template message: what to expect

Hi [insert name],

Thank you for joining our Money Movers group. [Insert personal message.] I'm so excited to share this time with you!

Money Movers is a movement of people supporting each other to take climate action with their personal finances – however much they have.

The sessions will be an informal and fun environment for us to co-explore our personal finances, the relationship between finances and the climate crisis, and some actions that we might want to take.

Location: [insert location of first meeting]

Date and time: [insert date and time of first meeting]

## What to expect

This isn't a typical education programme. Instead, it's about peer-to-peer learning – everyone pooling together to learn as a group. Money Movers provides a structure and a rhythm to help us explore topics and take action – but our group will lead the way. This approach is more empowering for everyone involved.

In our first session together, we'll dive into what matters to us personally and as a group, and imagine what a positive future could look like. We'll also explore some thought-provoking questions about climate finance and how we connect with it.

Over the next few weeks, we'll map out our financial situations and help each other move towards action.

## How to prepare

Please bring an object that represents your relationship with money to the first session. We'll share these at the start of the session. For inspiration, others have brought a fountain pen – because it feels full at the start of the month and a bit like it might run out at the end – and a cactus – because it's a spikey topic and often in drought, although occasionally it rains just enough.

We also ask that you fill out a pre-programme survey at the start of the journey and a post-programme survey at the end. This is vital to enable Money Movers to understand the impact of this movement, and demonstrate that ordinary people are a powerful force for climate action. Please complete the survey before our first session.

There's no need to prepare anything else. We'll learn and research together as we go. If you're desperate to get going, here are some resources I found useful.

If you have any questions or would like to chat about how we can make this journey work for you, please do reach out. I'd love to hear from you.

# Session 1: Dream + Connect

## Purpose

Dream + Connect is all about coming together as a group, getting to know each other and creating a friendly, safe space where you can talk openly about your finances without fear of judgement.

It's designed to immerse the group in the connection between finances and climate action. And it should help people connect to what impact might be possible through taking action together.

## Aims

- Create a welcoming, safe space where the group can speak freely about money and climate, especially people often left out by the financial sector.
- Support the group to start building relationships with one another.
- Immerse participants in questions that will get them thinking about climate finance and their relationship to it.
- Connect with personal and collective values, and a vision for what a positive future might look like.

|         | I know are thinking about what we as individuals can do and taking action in support of the planet.

"The money we put aside – whether through workplace pensions, savings or even just day-to-day current accounts – is busily shaping our future. But often our money is being used to fund activities we'd never dream of supporting directly: fossil fuels, exploitation of women and girls, weapons manufacture and so on. Banks have invested $6.9 trillion in fossil fuels since the Paris Climate Agreement was signed in 2016.

"But it is possible for our finances to have a huge positive impact on the planet. Did you know that switching to a greener pension is 21 times more powerful than giving up flying, going veggie and switching energy provider combined?

"Many people want to put their money to work for a fair and safe planet. But we're badly served by a jargon-filled financial system that often feels alienating, patronising and out of touch. It's not easy to develop financial confidence, navigate all the information out there or find the time to act, especially on our own.

"That's why I'm hosting this Money Movers group to explore these issues, learn together and support one another to take action. I'm not an expert. I'm volunteering to host this space for us and want to learn at the same time as you. I can't give financial advice and you should always carry out your own research before making any financial or investment decisions based on information shared in this group. I'm hoping we'll create a fun, friendly space to keep looking into these topics and building momentum to take action. |         |
| 10 mins | Create your group agreement

Share with the group: "Group agreements are a really helpful way to agree how we'll make the space feel as safe as possible. We'll all likely have different needs, preferences and experiences, so having a discussion at the start helps us to understand how we can create a supportive space throughout the 3 sessions."

Create quiet reflection space on the following questions:

• What will help us to feel safe to share with one another?
• Are there any behaviours or values we want to uphold?
• What else is important about how we are as a group during these 3 sessions? | In person: paper/ post-its and pens

Online: shared document, eg a digital whiteboard |

|         | Invite a discussion on what should be in your group agreement. Keep hold of the agreement for subsequent sessions. | |
|         | Example: "We'll value difference and avoid making comparisons, listen actively so everyone can feel heard, and be open but only share what we want to." | |
| 40 mins | Conversation menu | In person or online: write these questions out like a food menu |
|         | Share with the group: "This activity is all about open discussion, to immerse ourselves in the topic of finances and climate action. No one needs to share anything they don't feel comfortable with." | |
|         | Pick questions from the menu, and invite the group to discuss them. | In person: cut them up and put them in bowls to invite people to select them |
|         | • Who are your financial role models? | |
|         | • What's the best conversation you've ever had about money? Why? | |
|         | • We often hear the phrase "saving for the future". What kind of future do you dream of saving for? | |
|         | • How would you like to see your savings being used in an ideal world? | |
|         | • When you think of "climate change and finances," what comes to mind? | |
|         | • Do you know what your bank does with your money? | |
|         | • Have you tried to align your money with your values? If so, what was your experience? | |
|         | As the host, you might like to encourage quieter members of the group to bring their perspective. Some people in your group may be more confident talking about finances than others. | |
|         | Aim to ensure everyone speaks (if they'd like to) and no one takes the mic excessively! | |
| 10 mins | Check-out and actions | In person: paper/ post-its and pens |
|         | Share with the group: "We're coming to the end of the session, so we've now got some time to think about what we're taking away from this discussion and any actions we want to take. We'll do this each session, and then check back in on our actions next time we come together." | |

# Money Map

## Personal Money Map

This map is a tool designed to help you reflect on your personal finances. Completing the 3 stages of the Money Map will help you gain new insight into your habits and choices – and come up with ideas for how you could take climate action by making some changes.

Money can feel very personal. If there are any instructions you don't want to respond to, that's totally fine, please move on to the next stage.

You'll end up with more questions than you started with. That's exactly the point! Your Money Movers peer group will support you to explore some of these questions further.

### Making your map:

- Annotate digitally eg by inserting a text box to complete the map
- Print out the map from the following page
- Copy and draw your own.

[The image shows two photographs of groups of people holding up large sheets of paper with handwritten notes, presumably their completed Money Maps.]

# Your Money Map

## Step 1: pick your headings

Everyone's finances are different, so pick the 6 headings that feel most relevant to you from the list below and add them to each segment of your map.

- Pensions
- Current accounts
- Savings
- Mortgage
- Credit cards/ debts
- Investments
- Charitable giving
- Direct debits, bills and subscriptions
- Informal giving
- Day-to-day spending

## Step 2: map

For each of the headings, add post-its of the companies/ services/ providers who receive or interact with your money. Eg in the "current accounts" segment, you might write: "Starling joint account, Nationwide personal".

## Step 3: reflect

For each heading, we invite you to respond to the 3 questions below. You can do this in any way you like: with highlighters, notes, drawing, doodles - whatever feels right to you.

In relation to this heading and the climate crisis:

1. Where do you need more information? Highlight red.
2. Where do you feel like your finances are aligned with your values? Why? Highlight green.
3. Where do you see an opportunity for taking action or making a change? Highlight purple.

## Timings

## What's happening?

As host, celebrate the differences. People will sometimes bunch together, so ask them if that's how they really feel.

### Spectrum statements:
- I live for marmite <-------> Marmite is gross!
- I love sunshine <-------> Sunshine is the enemy
- I like talking about money <-------> I don't like talking about money
- I know what my bank does with my money <-------> I don't know what my bank does with my money
- I understand how finance is connected to the climate crisis <-------> I don't understand how finance is connected to the climate crisis
- My financial choices feel intentional and aligned to my values <-------> My financial choices don't feel intentional and aligned to my values

## Resources

## 40 mins

### Personal Money Maps

Invite people to team up in groups of 2-3 and share their Money Maps with one another. (20 mins)

Remind the group: "Try to avoid giving each other advice, and enjoy the power of just listening to one another!"

Then ask the groups to:

Uncover some insights (10 mins)

What reflections has this exercise provoked? What surprised you? What patterns can you spot? Ask each group to record their 3 top insights.

### Come up with ideas for actions (10 mins)

What actions could you take? Come up with as many as possible, big and small. Which actions could move the most money (even if they require more energy)?

Ideas for actions: Research new options | Switch bank, savings or pension provider | Move your mortgage or insurer | Make a green investment | Organise your finances | Invite an ethical independent financial adviser (IFA) to speak to your group/ family | Save more monthly | Lobby your employer on their policies eg their pension provider | Write to your MP/ local councillor | Talk to family and friends | Spend more locally.

# Session 3: Support + Act

## Purpose

This session has the strongest focus on getting practical. Your group will use this session to get some stuff done and to help one another work through where you're feeling stuck to move closer towards action.

## Aims

- Create a buzz of activity. This is the session where people can really feel they've done something: read that article, sent that message to their bank, asked that question of their partner or employer etc.

- Use the power of the group to help everyone move towards action - through helping one another and using the protected time and accountability of all being there together.

- Celebrate the journey you've all been on over the past 3 sessions. Really highlight the fact you've all taken part in a wider movement of climate action led by ordinary people!

# After the session

You made it! Well done. You're an incredible movement builder. Thank you.

After the session, there'll be a few final bits to share with your group:

- A massive thank you!
- Any other follow-up. Would your group like to keep supporting each other, and if so what would they want this to look like?
- The post-programme survey. Encourage participants to fill this in within 1-2 weeks. It's an important way to see how our small actions are adding up to make a difference.
- An invitation to your group to share what they've done with colleagues and friends – they may want to join in too! We'd love for you to share photos on social media and tag us @friends_earth

# FAQs

# How could individual financial choices positively impact the climate?

There's growing recognition that the role of finance is crucial in solving the climate crisis. Many Brits (47% according to YouGov research in 2017) want to make money and make a positive difference to the world, and we're reflecting this desire in our ethical and sustainable consumer choices. But we're not yet reflecting this in our personal finances, savings and investments.

More than half (53%) of us are now choosing to avoid buying products and services if we have concerns about the retailer's activities or the origin and impact of our purchases (according to a survey commissioned by not-for-profit organisation Ethical Consumer and Triodos Bank in 2016). By contrast, ethical and sustainable investment funds are still niche, representing just 1.2% of the total assets held by funds in the UK as of 2019. The ethical banking space is also comparatively small, managing just £21 billion of a possible £125 billion in 2019.

There's huge opportunity to align our money with our principles, from pension divestment to green investing. But there's a widespread lack of understanding about finances, and the connection between finance and the environment. Participating in Money Movers is one route to growing your understanding and making changes.

# Why aren't you providing a list of financial products and services that you think are the most ethical?

Money Movers is a peer-support community. We never give financial advice. And that goes for Friends of the Earth and any of our partners, hosts, participants or contributors as well. Any information that's shared through this network is done with the intention of helping participants to undertake their own independent research.

Hosts and participants are taking part in a voluntary capacity. Each individual should carry out their own research before making any financial or investment decisions based on information shared by hosts or other participants. We've compiled a guide to green finance with some useful resources to act as a starting point for independent research. Individuals may decide to seek additional professional financial advice where appropriate. We think this approach is ultimately more empowering for each individual.

To encourage safe, informal spaces conducive to the aims of our movement, Money Movers won't give anything that constitutes financial advice.

# How can I learn more about hosting safer spaces?

As a result of systemic injustice, not all societies, communities and spaces will be as safe for some people as others. People marginalised by systemic oppression (eg racism, sexism, ableism, transphobia, classism, homophobia and more) may not be as safe in a space as people whose identities are favoured within these systems. In addition, those affected by trauma will feel different amounts of safety in different spaces.

We can't therefore determine any space as "safe". But we can invite the people in our spaces to share what might help them feel safer (though they may not always share – and that's ok).

We don't tend to talk about hosting "comfortable" spaces. This is because learning and growth often happen when we edge outside our comfort zones into our "stretch zone" (though not as far as the "panic zone"). Also, those with more power and privilege tend to expect to feel comfortable and can feel confronted when topics such as race or gender are discussed.

Money Movers is for people who'd like to grow their financial confidence, so those who are generally marginalised by and under-represented in the financial sector may find it particularly helpful. Evidence shows that women and non-binary people experience this marginalisation, as do other minority groups. If you're a man hosting a space, it's very important to carefully consider how you can create a safer space for group members with minority identities.

## Tips for hosting safer spaces

1. Build meaningful relationships with people in your group, based on listening and trust.

2. Examine your own privileges and biases. Commit to ongoing learning about these privileges.

3. Stay humble. You won't always get it right, and that's ok. The important thing is to stay open to learning.

4. Be honest. It's ok to share when a mistake has been made.

# What's the difference between money and finance?

Money is primarily about exchange (think coins and notes), while finance is all about how money is managed, especially in a larger sense for organisations and governments. Finance describes the management, creation and study of money, banking, credit, investments, assets and liabilities that make up financial systems. Finance can be divided into 3 categories: public finance, corporate finance and personal finance.

Public finance includes tax systems, government expenditures, budget procedures, stabilisation policy and instruments, debt issues and other government concerns. Corporate finance involves managing assets, liabilities, revenues and debt for a business. Personal finance includes all the financial decisions and activities of an individual or household, including budgeting, insurance, mortgage planning, savings and retirement planning.

# What's green finance?

Green finance is all about moving to a green financial system and investment in a green future.

Green finance is about both "greening" finance (ensuring that financial decision making focuses on the risks and opportunities for our climate, eg stopping financing fossil fuels) and "financing green" (accelerating financial support for the delivery of climate solutions like cutting carbon, protecting against climate impacts and growing green sectors).

As an individual, you can think about the financial products, services or investments that you hold, and the extent to which they're aligned with positive environmental impacts. Is your pension pot financing fossil fuels or renewable energy, for example?
