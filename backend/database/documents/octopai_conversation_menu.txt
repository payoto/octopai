future do you dream of saving for?' 
Objectives of the question:  
o  Connect with personal and collective values, and a vision for what a positive 
future might look like. 
o  The vision should help guide the decisions the group make about what to do with 
their money, as they go further through the Money Movers programme. 
 
In this scenario, Alex is a skilled host, making sure everyone is heard, coaching people 
to draw out more ideas when they feel stuck, building connection within the group and 
gently stopping individuals from dominating the conversation.  
 
Host (Alex): Alright everyone, let’s dive into the next question. We often hear the phrase 
“Saving for the future.” But I want to take a moment to really explore this together. 
What kind of future do you each dream of saving for? There’s no wrong answer here—
it’s all about your personal vision. Who’d like to start? 
Emma: Um, I can go. I think...for me, it’s about my kids. I want to save for a future where 
they don’t have to worry about things like, I don’t know, clean air or fresh water. I want 
them to live in a world where those things are just...given, not something they have to 
fight for. 
Host (Alex): That’s powerful, Emma. Wanting a future for your kids where clean air and 
water are just a part of life—it’s such a deep and important dream. Thank you for 
sharing that. Who else wants to add? 
Sam: I think for me it’s about community. I’d like to save for a future where we’re all a 
little more connected—where money isn’t just about individual gain, but about building 
something together. Maybe funding community projects or green spaces where we can 
all benefit. It’s less lonely that way, you know? 
  
Host (Alex): Absolutely, Sam. A future where community and connection are at the 
centre—that’s a beautiful way to think about saving. It sounds like you're saying it's not 
just about security, but also about belonging and shared wellbeing. That’s inspiring. 
What about you, Priya? 
Priya: I guess I’m still figuring it out. I’ve always thought of saving as just...making sure 
I’m okay, like having enough for emergencies. But if I think bigger, I want to save for a 
future where the environment is stable. Like, where we’ve managed to fix some of the 
things that are broken now—like, renewable energy being the norm and less waste 
everywhere. 
Host (Alex): That’s such an honest reflection, Priya. It’s totally okay to still be figuring it 
out. I love how you linked your own stability to the environment’s stability—they’re 
really connected, right? Thanks for bringing that perspective. 
Michael: I’ll jump in. I think...I want to save for a future where my choices don’t harm 
others. Like, investing in things that help the planet instead of hurting it. I’ve been 
thinking about where my money goes, and I’d like it to be used for good, you know? Not 
just profit for profit’s sake. 
Host (Alex): Thanks for sharing, Michael. I’d love to hear from Jenna next. Let’s make 
sure everyone has a chance to contribute before we come back to any other thoughts. 
Michael: Oh, right, sure. Sorry about that. 
Host (Alex): No problem, Michael—I appreciate your enthusiasm. Jenna, would you like 
to share your thoughts? 
Jenna: Yeah, sure. For me, it’s...about fairness. I want to save for a future where 
everyone has enough. Not just me, but people who are struggling now too. Like, using 
my savings or investments to support things that help reduce inequality. I just feel like 
it’s not really a good future unless we all get to be a part of it. 
Host (Alex): Wow, Jenna, that’s so powerful. A future rooted in fairness and inclusion—
making sure that as you save, it helps lift others too. That’s such a generous vision, and 
it really shows how deeply you care about equality. Thank you for that. 
Host (Alex): Okay, now I’d love to hear from Chris. Chris, what are your thoughts on this? 
Chris: Honestly, I’m not sure. I’ve never really thought about saving for the future in this 
way before. I mean, I know I should save, but I don’t know what kind of future I’m really 
aiming for. 
Host (Alex): That’s totally okay, Chris. It’s actually really common to feel that way—
sometimes we’re so focused on just getting by that it’s hard to imagine the bigger 
picture. How about we try this: what’s one thing you’d love to see change in the world? It 
doesn’t have to be about money—just anything that feels important to you. 
Chris: Hmm... I guess I’d like to see less pollution. Like, I hate seeing plastic everywhere, 
especially in the oceans. It just feels wrong. 
Host (Alex): That’s a great start, Chris. So maybe part of the future you’re saving for is 
one where we’ve cleaned up our environment—where the oceans are free of plastic, 
  
and we’ve found better ways to take care of our planet. That’s a really meaningful 
vision, and it’s something we can definitely think about when we talk about how to use 
our money. Thanks for sharing that—it’s really valuable. 
Host (Alex): I just want to take a moment to say thank you to all of you. The futures 
you’re dreaming of are all different, but they share so many values: care for others, care 
for the planet, a desire for fairness and community. It’s amazing to hear. Let’s keep 
these visions in mind as we think about our next steps—how we can use our money to 
move closer to these futures. 
Host (Alex): Now that we’ve all shared our individual visions, I’d love for us to take a 
moment to reflect on what we’ve heard from each other. It can be really powerful to 
hear how others are thinking about the future. Does anyone want to respond to 
something that really resonated with them, or perhaps share a thought that’s come up 
after hearing everyone else? 
Emma: I really liked what Sam said about community. It made me realize that I’ve been 
thinking mostly about my own family, but I think it would be amazing if my kids grew up 
in a place where people genuinely cared about each other, not just themselves. It’s 
something I hadn’t really considered before. 
Host (Alex): That’s a beautiful reflection, Emma. It’s wonderful how hearing Sam’s vision 
helped you expand your own. Community really is such an important part of a thriving 
future. 
Sam: Thanks, Emma. And I feel the same way about what Jenna said. I hadn’t thought 
much about fairness in terms of my savings, but it really hit me how important it is that 
we’re not just looking out for ourselves but making sure others have enough too. It’s 
made me think about how I could use my savings in a way that has a bigger impact. 
Host (Alex): That’s fantastic, Sam. It’s amazing to see how these ideas are starting to 
connect. Jenna, how does it feel to hear that your vision has inspired Sam? 
Jenna: It feels really good, actually. I think sometimes it’s easy to feel like your values 
are just...yours, and maybe they don’t matter as much to others. But hearing that it’s 
resonated makes me feel like we really are all in this together, trying to create 
something better. 
Priya: I agree with that, Jenna. And honestly, hearing all of you has helped me think 
bigger. I liked what Chris said about pollution—it made me realize that I want to do more 
than just be stable. I want to make sure I’m contributing to a cleaner environment too. I 
guess I hadn’t connected those dots before. 
Host (Alex): That’s wonderful, Priya. It sounds like all of these visions are helping each of 
us broaden our own. Chris, I’d love to hear how you feel after hearing everyone else’s 
reflections. 
Chris: I think it’s helped me a lot. I was so unsure at first, but hearing everyone’s ideas 
has given me more clarity. I think I want to do something that combines all of this—like 
being stable myself, but also helping clean up the planet and maybe supporting others 
too. It doesn’t feel as overwhelming now that I’ve heard everyone else. 
  
Host (Alex): That’s amazing, Chris. It sounds like this conversation has really helped 
bring your vision into focus, and that’s exactly what we’re here for—to support each 
other as we figure it out. Thank you all for being open and reflective. I think we’re 
building something really special together. Let’s carry these reflections with us as we 
move forward. 
2. How it could go wrong - 'We often hear the phrase “saving for the future”. What 
kind of future do you dream of saving for?' 
In this scenario, Alex isn’t confident hosting and struggles. Some people don’t feel 
heard and the group closes feeling despondent and disconnected.  
Host (Alex): Alright everyone, let’s dive into the next question. We often hear the phrase 
“Saving for the future.” But, um, I guess we should, like, explore this together. What kind 
of future do you each dream of saving for? Uh, anyone want to start? Don’t be shy... 
Emma: Um, I can go. I think...for me, it’s about my kids. I want to save for a future where 
they don’t have to worry about things like, I don’t know, clean air or fresh water. I want 
them to live in a world where those things are just...given, not something they have to 
fight for. 
Host (Alex): Oh, um, okay. Thanks, Emma. Anyone else want to add? Uh, maybe expand 
on that? Michael? 
Michael: Yeah, I’ve got a lot to say about this. I think we need to be way more serious 
about how we invest our money. Like, it should be about making a real impact. I mean, if 
we’re just saving for ourselves, what does that even do? I think— 
Sam (trying to interject): I actually wanted to add something— 
Michael (continuing): Hold on, Sam. I’m saying that we need to be thinking big here. Not 
just about ourselves. We need to save for the planet, for our community, for— 
Host (Alex, unsure): Uh, Michael, um, maybe we should let Sam, uh, say something now? 
Michael: Oh, right. Sure. 
Sam: Thanks. I guess for me, it’s more about community. I think it’s important that we 
use our money to, like, bring people together, you know? To create green spaces or 
something. But, um, I don’t know, it’s kind of hard to figure out how to actually do that. 
Host (Alex): Yeah, yeah, okay. Um, anyone else? Priya, do you have anything? 
Priya: Uh, I guess I’m still figuring it out. I’ve always thought of saving as just making 
sure I’m okay. Like, for emergencies. But maybe I should think bigger? I don’t know... 
Michael (interrupting): Yeah, exactly, Priya! That’s what I mean! We all need to think 
bigger! I think if we— 
Host (Alex, awkwardly): Uh, Michael, hold on. Let’s give Priya a chance to finish. 
Priya: Um, yeah, I was just saying, maybe I should think more about the environment or 
something. But it’s, um, kind of overwhelming. 
  
Host (Alex): Yeah, okay. Um, thanks, Priya. Uh, Jenna, do you want to add something? 
Jenna: I guess. I think it’s about fairness. I want a future where everyone has enough, 
you know? Like, it’s not just about me saving for myself. But, honestly, I don’t really 
know how to make that happen. 
Michael (interrupting again): Exactly! That’s what I’m talking about! We need to make 
sure everyone has enough, and— 
Host (Alex, flustered): Uh, Michael, maybe let’s just, um, let Jenna finish her thought? 
Michael: Oh, right. Sorry. 
Host (Alex): Chris, do you, uh, have anything to add? 
Chris: Honestly, I’m not sure. I’ve never really thought about saving for the future like 
this. I guess, um, maybe less pollution? I don’t know, I’m just not sure. 
Host (Alex): Uh, okay, Chris. That’s fine. Um, does anyone want to, like, respond to 
anything anyone else said? 
Michael: Yeah, I think we all need to be way more proactive. Like, we’re talking about 
fairness and pollution, but what are we actually doing about it? I think we need to— 
Emma (trying to speak up): I actually wanted to say something about— 
Michael (ignoring Emma): I think we need to start investing in green energy and making 
real changes, not just talking about it. 
Host (Alex, trying to regain control): Uh, Michael, let’s, um, let Emma speak for a 
moment? 
Emma: Thanks, Alex. I was just going to say that I liked what Sam said about community. 
But, honestly, I feel like we’re not really getting anywhere with this conversation... 
Host (Alex, nervously): Uh, yeah, I mean, maybe we’re all just, um, still figuring it out? Uh, 
anyone else? 
Sam: I kind of feel the same as Emma. I don’t really know what we’re supposed to be 
doing here. It feels like we’re just talking in circles. 
Priya: Yeah, I agree. It’s kind of hard to think about saving for the future when we’re not 
really sure what actions we can take. 
Host (Alex): Uh, okay. Well, um, maybe we can just, like, think about it more for next 
time? I guess we’ll just, um, leave it there for today. Thanks, everyone, for, uh, sharing... 
Jenna (murmuring): I don’t really feel like we accomplished anything... 
Michael: Yeah, we need a plan, not just talk. 
Host (Alex, defeated): Uh, yeah. Okay. Well, thanks anyway, everyone. Let’s, um, try 
again next time. 
  
3. How could OctopAI help 
An AI co-host would provide gentle nudges and prompts to steer the conversation in a 
more positive, productive direction, supporting the host while being mindful not to 
overshadow them.  
Challenges Include: 
  Participants are either too quiet or talking over each other. 
  The conversation lacks focus, with tangents pulling away from the original 
question. 
  Some participants feel unheard or are dominating the discussion. 
AI Co-Host Intervention Strategies: 
1.  Encouraging Equal Participation: 
o  "I notice we’ve heard some great points from a few voices so far. Let’s 
pause to invite thoughts from anyone who hasn’t had a chance to speak 
yet. I’d love to hear everyone's ideas—especially on what kind of future 
you each dream of saving for." 
2.  Refocusing the Discussion: 
o  "It seems like we’ve drifted a bit from our main question. Let’s circle back 
to the future we all want to save for. Would anyone like to share a vision 
that feels especially important to them?" 
3.  Affirming and Connecting Ideas: 
o  "I really appreciate the point you made, Alex, about community being 
central to your dream future. Does anyone else resonate with that or have 
a different idea about what a sustainable future looks like?" 
o  This both affirms contributions and creates a bridge for others to join the 
conversation. 
4.  Offering Gentle Prompts to Deepen Reflection: 
o  "That’s an interesting idea, Jamie. Could you tell us more about what that 
future would look like for you? I think diving deeper could help us all 
connect with it more vividly." 
o  This prompt helps enrich the conversation without dominating it. 
5.  Balancing Dominant Voices: 
o  If someone is taking over the conversation, "Thank you for sharing those 
insights, Chris. Let’s also take a moment to hear from others—what 
future do you envision?" 
o  This helps shift focus without cutting anyone off. 
  
6.  Identifying themes: 
o  "I’m hearing a lot of dreams for a future that feels more connected and 
sustainable. Do those feel like the right common threads?” 
By summarizing, It helps everyone see patterns and find common 
ground, making the conversation feel cohesive. 
7.  Celebrating Differences of Opinion: 
 
o  "I really appreciate how we’re hearing different visions of the future—
some focusing on technology, others on community, and even others on 
simplicity. These different perspectives are what make our conversation 
so powerful. Every dream adds a unique layer. Does anyone want to build 
on a perspective that’s different from their own?" 
o  This approach acknowledges and values diverse viewpoints, 
emphasizing that contrasting ideas are not only welcome but are also 
crucial for a well-rounded discussion.  
 
8.  Asking coaching questions  
o  “What do you need to find out to move forward? What might get in the 
way of you achieving this?” 
o  This approach helps participants move forward, feel empowered and 
explore the topic for themselves.  
In these interventions, OcotopAI’s goal would be to gently reframe or guide without 
taking over. It would aim to help the host and participants find a flow that invites 
meaningful sharing and creates a sense of shared purpose. 
4. AI Co-host version - 'We often hear the phrase “saving for the future”. What kind 
of future do you dream of saving for?' 
In this scenario, Alex is supported by an AI cohost. It was hard to get the balance right 
between the AI cohost completely taking over or being awkward/not adding much 
value. This is the closest I got to a collaborative version, but I don’t think it is quite right. 
ChatGPT struggled most to imagine how an AI co-host could help build the host’s 
confidence – they can be 2 equal cohosts or the AI can take over, but the nuance of 
supporting someone was hard to capture. I wonder if this is a problem we’ll have with 
the AI co-host we develop.  
 
Host (Alex): Alright everyone, let’s dive into the next question. We often hear the phrase 
"Saving for the future." Let’s explore this together—what kind of future do you each 
dream of saving for? Anyone want to start? I’d love to hear your thoughts. 
Emma: Um, I can go. I think...for me, it’s about my kids. I want to save for a future where 
they don’t have to worry about things like, I don’t know, clean air or fresh water. I want 
them to live in a world where those things are just...given, not something they have to 
fight for. 
  
AI Co-Host: That’s such a beautiful vision, Emma. I think a lot of us can connect with 
wanting a world where future generations have these basics covered. Alex, maybe we 
can see if others have similar thoughts or something a little different? 
Host (Alex): Great idea. Does anyone else have a different vision, or maybe something 
to add to Emma’s idea? 
Michael: Yeah, I’ve got a lot to say about this. I think we need to be way more serious 
about how we invest our money. Like, it should be about making a real impact. I mean, if 
we’re just saving for ourselves, what does that even do? I think— 
AI Co-Host (gently): Thanks, Michael, you bring up an important point about making an 
impact. Before diving too deeply, I think Sam was trying to share something—Sam, 
would you like to go ahead? 
Sam: Thanks. I guess for me, it’s more about community. I think it’s important that we 
use our money to, like, bring people together, you know? To create green spaces or 
something. But, um, I don’t know, it’s kind of hard to figure out how to actually do that. 
Host (Alex): Yeah, I love the idea of focusing on community, Sam. It feels like we’re 
starting to see a few themes—Emma talked about the basics for her kids, Michael’s 
thinking big about impact, and now you’re talking about community. AI, do you think 
there’s a thread here we could pull on? 
AI Co-Host: Absolutely, Alex. I think it’s wonderful how each of these visions touches on 
both personal and collective well-being. There’s something really powerful in the mix—
taking care of family, community, and the broader world. It might be helpful to hear 
more about how these pieces fit together. Priya, what’s your take? 
Priya: Uh, I guess I’m still figuring it out. I’ve always thought of saving as just making 
sure I’m okay. Like, for emergencies. But maybe I should think bigger? I don’t know... 
Host (Alex): Thanks for sharing that, Priya. It’s completely understandable to start from 
the idea of security for yourself. AI, what do you think about how Priya’s point fits in 
here? 
AI Co-Host: I think Priya’s honesty is really important. It highlights a foundational aspect 
of saving—the desire to make sure we’re okay before we expand our focus. That’s 
something I think many people can relate to. It’s part of what makes the larger visions 
possible, right? Jenna, I’m curious—what are your thoughts? 
Jenna: I guess. I think it’s about fairness. I want a future where everyone has enough, 
you know? Like, it’s not just about me saving for myself. But, honestly, I don’t really 
know how to make that happen. 
Host (Alex): That’s really powerful, Jenna. I think fairness is such a core part of what 
many of us hope for. AI, do you think we could maybe explore how different visions like 
Jenna’s connect? 
AI Co-Host: Definitely. What’s great here is that we’re hearing different ways to think 
about the future—from family security to community strength to fairness for all. Maybe 
we could take a moment to reflect: how do these different dreams come together in a 
way that feels meaningful?  
  
Michael: Yeah, exactly! We all need to think bigger and— 
AI Co-Host (gently redirecting): Hold on for just a second, Michael. I really want us to 
hear Jenna’s complete thought first. Jenna, anything else you’d like to add before we 
move on? 
Jenna: Um, I guess just that I want us to find ways to make sure everyone can thrive, not 
just a few people. 
Host (Alex): Thanks, Jenna. That’s such an important piece of the puzzle. Chris, what are 
you thinking? 
Chris: Honestly, I’m not sure. I’ve never really thought about saving for the future like 
this. I guess, um, maybe less pollution? I don’t know, I’m just not sure. 
AI Co-Host: Thanks for being open, Chris. Sometimes these big questions can feel 
overwhelming, and that’s completely okay. Even the idea of wanting less pollution is a 
powerful vision—it’s something tangible we can all relate to. Could you say more on why 
pollution stands out to you, Chris?  
Chris: Um, I guess it’s similar to Jenna actually. I want to feel like I like in a place that’s 
healthy and full of life.  
AI Co-Host: Thanks, Chris. That feels like you’re onto something really important. Alex, 
maybe we could see how people are feeling about what’s been shared so far? 
Host (Alex): Yeah, I like that. How is everyone feeling about the different visions we’ve 
heard? Does anything stand out to you or make you think differently? 
Emma: I think it’s really interesting how everyone’s coming from a slightly different 
place, but there’s overlap too. I mean, we all want a better future, right? 
Sam: Yeah, I agree. I think the different ideas are helping me see that it’s not just one 
thing—it’s family, community, fairness, all of it together. 
AI Co-Host: That’s such a great observation, Sam. It’s the mix of perspectives that really 
brings depth to what we’re discussing. There’s no one "right" way. 
Host (Alex): I think we’re starting to get somewhere really interesting. Thanks so much, 
everyone, for sharing so openly. Let’s keep reflecting on these ideas and maybe next 
time, we can dig even deeper into how we connect on these vision. 
AI Co-Host: Absolutely. Today’s conversation has brought out so many important 
themes. I’m excited to keep exploring this with all of you. Thanks again, everyone, for 
being part of this. 
5. AI Co-host version - "Do you know what your bank does with your money?" 
Objectives of the question:  
o  Encourage participants to reflect and consider their own research, in the 
context of climate and finance.  
o  The group feels safe enough to express what they don’t know.  
  
In this scenario, the AI Host has more opportunities to signpost to resources and 
provide clarifying information about the financial system.  
Use this guide and the links within it to train the AI https://friendsoftheearth.uk/take-
action/your-guide-green-finance 
 
Host (Alex): Alright everyone, here’s our next question: "Do you know what your bank 
does with your money?" I know it’s not something we think about every day, but it could 
have a big impact, especially when it comes to climate. I’d love to hear your initial 
thoughts—has anyone looked into this before? 
Emma: Um, not really. I guess I just assumed the bank keeps it safe and loans it out to 
people, but I haven’t thought much beyond that. 
AI Co-Host: That’s a really common assumption, Emma, and it’s a great place to start. A 
lot of people think that’s all their bank is doing, but there’s usually a lot more going on 
behind the scenes. Alex, do you want to see if anyone else has thought about it 
differently? 
Host (Alex): Absolutely. Michael, what about you? Have you ever thought about what 
happens to your money after you deposit it? 
Michael: Yeah, I’ve thought about it a bit. I read that banks invested in fossil fuels, but I 
kind of assumed that was a thing of the past. I mean, it’s 2024—aren’t most banks 
switching to green investments now? 
AI Co-Host: That’s a really interesting point, Michael. It would be nice to think that most 
banks have fully switched over to green investments by now, but unfortunately, the 
UK’s leading banks (Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, NatWest and Santander) still pour billions 
into fossil fuels, even in 2024.  
Host (Alex): It’s eye-opening to think that the money we keep in a bank might be used 
for things we don’t personally support. I’m curious—does anyone else have thoughts on 
this, or does this come as a bit of a surprise? 
Sam: Yeah, I’m kind of surprised. I never really connected my bank account with climate 
issues – maybe for people with big investments, but not my day-to-day stuff. I guess I 
just thought of it as a place to keep my money, not as something that could have a 
bigger impact. It’s kind of weird to think my savings could be doing harm. 
AI Co-Host: I know what you mean, Sam. It can be unsettling to realize that something 
we use every day might have a hidden side. You can 100% start small and still have an 
impact. Here are some cool stories about women who are investing £25 a month into 
ethical funds.  
Host (Alex): That’s reassuring. Priya, do you have any thoughts on this? 
Priya: Honestly, I don’t know much about it. But now I’m wondering... how would you 
even find out? Like, do banks tell you where they invest your money? 
  
AI Co-Host: That’s a great question, Priya. It’s not always obvious, is it? Sometimes 
banks don’t make it easy to find out exactly what they’re funding. The Banking on 
Climate Chaos report can be a good place to start. I’ll share it with you in the chat.  
Host (Alex): Good idea. I think one thing we could do is encourage everyone to start by 
checking their bank’s website or even asking directly. They might have sustainability 
reports or policies posted online. Jenna, do you think this is something you’d want to 
want to look into? 
Jenna: I think so. I mean, if my money is being used for something like that, I’d want to 
know. But it feels a bit intimidating, like I wouldn’t even know what to look for or what 
the right questions are to look into. 
AI Co-Host: Totally understandable, Jenna. It can feel like diving into the deep end. Alex, 
do you think we could help everyone brainstorm some questions to ask their banks? 
Host (Alex): I love that idea. Let’s take a moment and come up with some questions 
together. For example, you could ask, "Does my bank have a policy on investing in fossil 
fuels?" or "What percentage of your investments go toward renewable energy 
projects?" 
Chris: Yeah, I like that. It makes it seem more manageable. I guess I could call my bank 
and just ask. I feel like they might not give a clear answer, though. 
AI Co-Host: That’s a fair point, Chris. Sometimes it takes persistence, or even 
comparing answers between banks. The financial journalists at Good With Money have 
put together some useful guides on the top ethical banks, which is the flip side of the 
coin in terms of how to approach it.  
Host (Alex): Thanks, it’s interesting to think about which banks are doing better in this 
area. Sarah, what’s your take?  
Sarah: Hmmm, I have a much better idea than I used to, because of the bank that I’m 
with, which is Triodos. When you sign up you have to say you’re not going to do quite a 
range of horrible things as a customer and they in turn say what they will and won’t do 
with your money. So, I have a rough idea of what my bank is supporting and not, but I 
still feel really woolly about how they do it in practice, if that makes sense. I’d love to 
learn more about that.  
Host (Alex): Thanks, Sarah. That would be a really great thing to do some more research 
into and share back to the group. It can all feel really abstract when it comes to money.  
AI-Co-Host: The Ethical Consumer’s Ethical Money guide.   could be a good place to 
start with that, Sarah.  
Sam: Yeah, I feel the same. Sometimes it’s hard to really imagine that my individual 
financial choices impact the climate. It feels like it’s big and out of my control. What I 
buy in the supermarket, for instance, feels more tangible.  
AI Co-Host: I think that’s a really common feeling, Sam. More than half of us are now 
choosing to avoid buying products and services if we have concerns about the retailer’s 
activities or the origin and impact of our purchases. By contrast, ethical and sustainable 
investment funds are still niche, representing just 1.2% of the total assets held by funds 
  
in the UK as of 2019. The ethical banking space is also comparatively small, managing 
just £21 billion of a possible £125 billion in 2019. There’s a huge opportunity to align our 
money with our principles.  
Host (Alex): Yeah, and I think the key takeaway here is that we have more influence than 
we might realize. Asking questions, doing some research, and deciding where we want 
our money to be—it all adds up. Thanks, everyone, for being open to exploring this. 
AI Co-Host: I really appreciate everyone’s curiosity and openness today. Let’s keep this 
conversation going, and next time, we can see what we’ve learned.
