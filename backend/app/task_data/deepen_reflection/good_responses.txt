That’s such an honest and relatable response—thank you for sharing. Saving for emergencies is so important; it’s like creating a safety net for yourself. And you’re absolutely right—there’s this exciting opportunity to think about what saving could mean beyond just security. If your savings could also help create the kind of future you’d like to see, what might that look like for you? Even if it feels vague right now, what comes to mind when you imagine that?

Thanks for being open, Chris. Sometimes these big questions can feel
overwhelming, and that’s completely okay. Even the idea of wanting less pollution is a
powerful vision—it’s something tangible we can all relate to. Could you say more on why
pollution stands out to you, Chris?
