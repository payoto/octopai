Uh, I guess I’m still figuring it out. I’ve always thought of saving as just making
sure I’m okay. Like, for emergencies. But maybe I should think bigger? I don’t know...

Honestly, I’m not sure. I’ve never really thought about saving for the future like
this. I guess, um, maybe less pollution? I don’t know, I’m just not sure.
