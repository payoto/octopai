I notice we’ve heard some great points from a few voices so far. Let’s
pause to invite thoughts from anyone who hasn’t had a chance to speak
yet. I’d love to hear everyone's ideas—especially on what kind of future
you each dream of saving for.

Thanks, Michael, you bring up an important point about making an
impact. Before diving too deeply, I think Sam was trying to share something—Sam,
would you like to go ahead?
